# Hologram Settings
# These settings allow you to customize the color of the "Time Left" field in claim holograms, perfect for matching your server's theme!
#
# How does it work?
# - Each threshold defines a time condition and a color.
# - threshold: Time condition (e.g., "day >= 2", "day < 1", "minute <= 5")
# - color: Color code (e.g., "&a", "&e", "&c", hex: "<#FF0000>")
#
# Thresholds are checked in order; the first matching one is used.
# Example:
#   - threshold: "day >= 2"   -> If days left is 2 or more, use &a (green)
#   - threshold: "day >= 1"   -> If days left is 1 or more, use &e (yellow)
#   - threshold: "day < 1"    -> If days left is less than 1, use &c (red)
#
# Add as many thresholds/colors as you like for your server!
# Tip:
# You don't need to shut down and restart the server or use a full reload to process the thresholds;
# you can apply them in-game by simply using the /nclaim admin reload command.
