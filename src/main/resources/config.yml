# World Restrictions
# Configure which worlds and WorldGuard regions are restricted from claiming
blacklisted_worlds:
  - world   # Example: Main world

# Claim Settings
claim_settings:
  max_count: 3        # Maximum number of claims per player
  buy_price: 1500     # Cost to create a new claim
  expand_price: 2000  # Cost to expand an existing claim by one chunk

  # Land expansion GUI settings
  expand_menu_height: 2  # Controls the vertical size of an expansion menu (1-3)
  expand_menu_width: 2   # Controls the horizontal size of an expansion menu (1-3)
  # These values determine how many chunks around your main claim are shown in the GUI
  # Formula: GUI rows = (height * 2 + 1), maximum 6 rows
  # Examples:
  # height=1, width=1 → 3x3 chunk grid in 3 rows (27 slots)
  # height=2, width=2 → 5x5 chunk grid in 5 rows (45 slots)
  # height=3, width=3 → 7x7 chunk grid in 6 rows (54 slots, maximum)

  # TIERED PRICING SYSTEM (Maximum 41 chunks)
  tiered_pricing:

    # HOW IT WORKS:
    # Your claim starts with 1 chunk (main chunk)
    # You can expand up to 41 chunks total
    # Price increases with each tier

        price: 500      # 500 coins per chunk
        # Total: 9 chunks x 500 = 4,500 coins

        min: 16         # Starting from the 16th chunk

        price: 1000     # 1000 coins per chunk
        # Total: 10 chunks x 1000 = 10,000 coins

        price: 2500     # 2500 coins per chunk
        # Total: 10 chunks x 2500 = 25,000 coins

      # EXPERT LEVEL (36th-41st chunks)
      tier5:
        min: 36         # Starting from the 36th chunk
        max: 41         # Up to 41st chunk (MAX)
        price: 5000     # 5000 coins per chunk
